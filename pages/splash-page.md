    title: "A unified mediation analysis framework for integrative cancer proteogenomics with clinical outcomes"
    excerpt: 'We develop a general mediation analysis framework for proteogenomic data that include multiple exposures, multivariate mediators on various scales of effects as appropriate for continuous, binary and survival outcomes. Multilevel molecular profiling of tumors and the integrative analysis with clinical outcomes have enabled a deeper characterization of cancer treatment. Mediation analysis has emerged as a promising statistical tool to identify and quantify the intermediate mechanisms by which a gene affects an outcome. However, existing methods lack a unified approach to handle various types of outcome variables, making them unsuitable for high-throughput molecular profiling data with highly interconnected variables. Our estimation method avoids imposing constraints on model parameters such as the rare disease assumption, while accommodating multiple exposures and high-dimensional mediators. We compare our approach to other methods in extensive simulation studies at a range of sample sizes, disease prevalence and number of false mediators. Using kidney renal clear cell carcinoma proteogenomic data, we identify genes that are mediated by proteins and the underlying mechanisms on various survival outcomes that capture short- and long-term disease-specific clinical characteristics.'

    excerpt: 'Cancer progression and development are initiated by aberrations in various molecularnetworks through coordinated changes across multiple genes and pathways. It is important tounderstand how these networks change under different stress conditions and/or patient-speciﬁcgroups to infer differential patterns of activation and inhibition. Existing methods are limited to cor-relation networks that are independently estimated from separate group-speciﬁc data and withoutdue consideration of relationships that are conserved across multiple groups.'

    title: "iDINGO—integrative differential network analysis in genomics with Shiny application"
    excerpt: "Differential network analysis is a vital approach for unraveling the intricate network rewiring implicated in disease progression and development. By constructing differential networks from diverse 'omics data sources, we gain a comprehensive understanding of how interactive systems differ within distinct patient-specific groups. While DINGO has been invaluable in inferring group-specific dependencies and constructing differential networks, it and similar tools are constrained in their ability to analyze data stemming from a single platform. Furthermore, these tools often disregard the hierarchical structure intrinsic to multi-'omics data. To address these limitations, we introduce the iDINGO R package. This innovative tool estimates group-specific dependencies, providing insights into integrative differential networks while accounting for the biological hierarchy among 'omics platforms. Additionally, we've created a user-friendly Shiny application that streamlines the analysis and visualization of results, aiding in the identification of hub genes across platforms."

    title: "Personalized Integrated Network Modeling of the Cancer Proteome Atlas"
    excerpt: 'Personalized (patient-specific) approaches have recently emerged with a precision medicine paradigm that acknowledges the fact that molecular pathway structures and activity might be considerably different within and across tumors. The functional cancer genome and proteome provide rich sources of information to identify patient-specific variations in signaling pathways and activities within and across tumors; however, current analytic methods lack the ability to exploit the diverse and multi-layered architecture of these complex biological networks. We assessed pan-cancer pathway activities for >7700 patients across 32 tumor types from The Cancer Proteome Atlas by developing a personalized cancer-specific integrated network estimation (PRECISE) model. PRECISE is a general Bayesian framework for integrating existing interaction databases, data-driven de novo causal structures, and upstream molecular profiling data to estimate cancer-specific integrated networks, infer patient-specific networks and elicit interpretable pathway-level signatures. PRECISE-based pathway signatures, can delineate pan-cancer commonalities and differences in proteomic network biology within and across tumors, demonstrates robust tumor stratification that is both biologically and clinically informative and superior prognostic power compared to existing approaches. Towards establishing the translational relevance of the functional proteome in research and clinical settings, we provide an online, publicly available, comprehensive database and visualization repository of our findings: https://mjha.shinyapps.io/PRECISE/.'

    title: "A Bayesian integrative approach for multi-platform genomic data: A kidney cancer case study"
    excerpt: 'Integration of genomic data from multiple platforms has the capability to increase precision, accuracy, and statistical power in the identification of prognostic biomarkers. A fundamental problem faced in many multi-platform studies is unbalanced sample sizes due to the inability to obtain measurements from all the platforms for all the patients in the study. We have developed a novel Bayesian approach that integrates multi-regression models to identify a small set of biomarkers that can accurately predict time-to-event outcomes. This method fully exploits the amount of available information across platforms and does not exclude any of the subjects from the analysis. Through simulations, we demonstrate the utility of our method and compare its performance to that of methods that do not borrow information across regression models. Motivated by The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney renal cell carcinoma dataset, our methodology provides novel insights missed by non-integrative models.'
